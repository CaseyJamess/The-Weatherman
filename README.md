# caseys-weatherman

The Weatherman is an app to showcase the weather of any Town or City around the globe! Created using OpenWeather's API : https://openweathermap.org/api

Feel free to add any functionality changes or styles of your own :) 

You will need to create a .env file inside your directory and inside create  the REACT_APP_WEATHER_API_KEY & assign it the value of your own API Key

Included in this is react-bootstrap to allow for a simple, visualy appealing way to style the page using the bootstrap system

Next version coming: having a drop down menu to suggest locations whilst you are typing an input - and being able to click & use the suggested area. 

This allows the user for example to be able to specify locations that have the same name - i.e Manchester in Tennessee, USA vs the default which is Manchester in the UK

Happy Coding! 


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
